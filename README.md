Picoto Writer version 2.0, UPDATED!: A free word-processor made by me :)

Originally part of a work for the subject of Interface Development which in my free times I am including new features and updates, it uses Java and his GUI widget toolkit named Swing.

New functions in version 2!!!

* Export to PDF
* Refreshed interface
* New function of search text in Web
* Help Themes

Some functions:

- It works in rich text so you can format any word
- Read txt files
- Possibility to save in txt and rtf (Rich Text Format) files
- Print files by setting up the printer
- Left, right and center alignment for text
- Easter eggs as the file's transcriber (it comes from part of an exam exercise I had about this program haha)
